# MangoApps Design Guide

MangoApps Personalizations give every user their own individual experience. With personalized features employees can create the aesthetics, style, and organization they need to love their workspace and optimize efficiency.

## Features

#### Personalized Appearance

Allow employees to feel at home in MangoApps by letting them personalize the experience. Users alter the appearance of the portal with themes, photo styles, colors, and fonts, or set locale settings with date/time formats, time-zone, and their primary language of choice.

#### Engaging User Profiles

Users easily setup and maintain their user profiles, importing with one-click from LinkedIn or building from scratch. Profiles include name, background, education, and a number of other optional details. Users set a custom status to let co-workers know their current status or whats on the mind, without pushing a notification to their feed.

#### Newsfeed Organization

Organize news by importance into the primary or secondary feeds, configure the order of category tabs, and filter from newest or oldest on top to match working styles. In addition to viewing the newsfeed as they’ve personalized, users can see where they are mentioned, view pinned news, or filter to only see specific feed types, such as projects, updates, or groups.

#### Flexible Notifications

Control and set the importance of notifications to ensure that crucial moments are never missed. Users can select and filter their need for various notification types, and select how and when to be notified through web, desktop, mobile or by email. Chat notifications can be set to act persistently even when a user is in another browser tab. Notifications can also be configured as a scheduled digest, delivering through email at a daily or weekly frequency.

#### Portal Home Page

Log into MangoApps and see what is most important first. Users select their default home landing page for entry, or land on the default page selected by admins for all existing or new users.

#### Personalized Dashboard

MangoApps Dashboards give users updated and easy access to everything that matters, with powerful customizable widgets that put important announcements and resources at their fingertips. Allow users to organize their personalization with templates and any choice of widgets from the gallery, or do it for them with default templates, sticky widgets and different levels of permissions for customization.

#### Smart Reminders

Set reminders for events, tasks, join requests, file approvals or todos, select the lead time, and enable notifications on any device. Users also have the ability to ‘snooze’ reminders as they present, or create recurring reminders for the same item.

#### Administrator Control

MangoApps is truly built for Enterprises, giving all the necessary tools and power to the admins to set up and personalize the portal to the needs of the business and the company culture. Admins decide how to setup the portal, select necessary modules, organize primary navigation, lock in the templated design and features, and determine the level of personalization and permissions given to their users.
